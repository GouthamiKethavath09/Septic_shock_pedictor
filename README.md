## 📌 Overview
Septic shock is a life-threatening medical condition caused by severe infection, leading to organ failure and dangerously low blood pressure. Early detection is critical to improving survival rates.

This project presents an AI-powered clinical decision support system that predicts the risk of septic shock using time-series ICU patient data. The system integrates Deep Learning (LSTM) with an interactive Streamlit dashboard to provide real-time risk prediction, clinical insights, visual analytics, and actionable medical recommendations.

## 🎯 Objective
The main objective of this project is to assist healthcare professionals by:
- Detecting early signs of septic shock  
- Monitoring patient vitals continuously  
- Supporting faster and more accurate clinical decisions  
- Improving patient outcomes in ICU environments

## 🧠 System Workflow
1. Data Input  
   - Time-series ICU patient data (24 time steps)  
   - Multiple physiological parameters  

2. Data Preprocessing  
   - Normalization using MinMaxScaler  
   - Feature alignment  
   - Sequence creation for LSTM  

3. Model Prediction  
   - LSTM model captures temporal patterns  
   - Outputs probability of septic shock  

4. Visualization & Insights  
   - Risk meter (gauge chart)  
   - Vital trends  
   - Patient vs normal comparison  
   - AI-based medical interpretation

## 🧪 Input Data Format
The model expects a CSV file with:
- 24 rows (time steps)  
- 7 features  

### Features:
- Blood Pressure (bp)  
- Creatinine  
- Heart Rate  
- Lactate  
- Respiration Rate  
- Temperature  
- White Blood Cell Count (WBC)  

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- Model Type: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)  
- Input Shape: (24, 8)  
- Layers:
  - LSTM (64 units)  
  - Dropout  
  - LSTM (32 units)  
  - Dense (ReLU)  
  - Output Layer (Sigmoid)  

### Why LSTM?
LSTM is ideal for time-series healthcare data because it captures temporal dependencies and patterns across patient vitals over time.
